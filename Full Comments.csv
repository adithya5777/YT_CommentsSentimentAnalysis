@princestephenowealth3506,The blotware the comes with both infinix and Tecno phones grow over time and there are some that the phone will keep installing by itself even after you uninstall or disable the app.
@SachuBala,I think they could have given a 90hz amoled making it the best phone for multimedia consumption at this range
@varanggoel5773,"I found the Infinix company very interesting and innovative
This video is made in #collab with Infinix India."
@priyamchaudhuri,"It's hilarious how the presence of an audio jack is often followed by ""if you're an audiophile like me, you'll love this"".
You can't convince me that someone who's an audiophile with an 'audiophile' grade headphone will be using a 15k phone, while the phones which they tend to use don't have an audio port. Even then so, the wired headphones that said 'audiophile' has would be as good as a string telephone. 
So, kind of pointless to point out the necessity of this, don't you think?"
@mosgaming3076,"Samsung owns Harman
And Harman own JBL and infinity"
@simulify8726,"Whatever 
Megapixels != Better camera
You need better sensors and pixels capturing light as well as good software tweaking"
@lostintheblues.986,Harman owns more or less every audio company.
@asifzbaig,"One suggestion: When talking about price, do mention the variant that prices can buy, for example, here 15k price is for 128 GB variant and not 256 GB, that may create confusions for some. ."
@thelevi9928,"JBL  is owned by Harman International which is a part of Samsung. If you ever got a jbl product , it is mentioned in the user manual or simply it is mentioned after the brand logo itself"
@PANKAJKUMAR-lb5dh,Charge bypass really is a good feature
@atulkumarmishra7061,Why not to wait a lil bit and go for Lava Agni 2... It's just the best
@theycallmehazik,"I've been using infinix hot 10 since 21 oct 2020 which is more than 2.5 years and i would like to mention few things

1)They provide really good hardware for any price point but lack in software, software experience is not good on infinix mobiles 

2)Bugs are present , in day to day usage it becomes annoying

3) Over the time quality and performance degrades alot

4)They don't provide timely updates , and even if they provide it won't be more than once or twice (I'm still on Android 10)

5)Bloatwares are a major problem some of them get installed after updates and istg they are really really irritating 

These are my few complaints the main one is about the bugs and bloatwares

You won't ever feel like you are holding a good premium phone but a cheap one because that what it is. 

If these problems don't bother you, you can definitely buy infinix mobiles 

I will also shift to another company after 2-3 years more, if the device survives"
@ijs_diy,Is the missing secondary noise cancellation microphone really affect call and audio video quality?
@chdrytanishk,"JBL is owned by Harman, which is owned by Sammy"
